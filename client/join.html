        <h4>RULES:</h4>
        <p>
            This is a <b>four</b> player game, where each player has a hand of <b>tiles</b>.<br>
            The goal of the game is to have four sets of 3 tiles and one set of 2 tiles.<br>
            A 3 tiles set is defined as 3 of the same exact tile, or 3 consecutive tiles. 
            A set of 2 tiles is defined as 2 exact same tiles.<br>
            Each player takes turns. On their turn a player will first gain a tile and then <i>discard</i> a tile to end their turn. 
            The gained tile will either come from the previous player's discard or the <i>draw</i> pile.
            A player can only <i>steal</i> a tile from another player if it completes a set.
            The player will then have to <i>reveal</i> the completed set.
            A player can steal a tile out of turn if it completes a set of 3 identical tiles <b>OR</b> 
            if it is the final tile needed to win.
            Otherwise, players can only steal in the order of their turn.
        </p>
        ADDITIONAL RULES:
        <p>
            A player can also win by having seven sets of 2,
            but this player can only obtain tiles by drawing from the pile.
            A player may have the additional opportunity to draw a tile when they obtain 4 of the same tile.
            When a player obtains it on their own, the exact tile is not revealed.
            A player can obtain it from another player in the same way a player can obtain the tile if their have 2 of the same tile.
            A set of four tiles acts as a set of 3.
        </p>
